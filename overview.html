                We developed a system called AVINA (Accessibility and Visually Impaired Network Awareness) that can be set up within any location, indoor and outdoor, that can easily be deployed by an IT administrator.
                Connected to each of these systems are cameras using object recognition to capture information about the environment.              
              </p>
              <p>
                The main goal of our project is to assist visually impaired users to have a more inclusive access to public services such as hospital service, physical banking and leisure services. 
  With Sight++ and AVINA enabled, we hope to make indoor and outdoor places in future more accessible to visually impaired people without having them to rely on other people. 
  Visually impaired people will be able to access useful information of the environment around such as the location they are at in the building, how many people in the waiting queue, how seats are available currently, etc.

                AVINA consist of three different systems: the app, location server and organisation server. Along with this are Bluetooth beacons and NUCs (mini-PCs) and cameras.

                <p class="card-text">
                  The app is created with Flutter is installed on Android devices.

                  Visually impaired user uses this app to communicate the with the location server. The location sends information about the location to the user, and it is read through voice over back to the user. The user can also ask questions about the location—these can be room specific questions about the seating ability or the queue length, or more generic questions like ‘what are the peak times?’

                  Both the input and output of the app are multilingual, so it works with whatever language the user has set their device to.

                <p class="card-text">
                  The location server is what the app connects to. Once the app comes within range of the server it will try to initiate a connection. When a connection has been established, the user will begin to receive environmental information about the location and are allowed to ask questions.

                  The app is also connected to NUC/cameras to get the real-time events happing in the room where the camera is setup. Records from the cameras are sent to the server to be stored.

                  An Azure QnA chatbot is also connected to the server to handle general question that come from the user. The chatbot will respond and server will send this back to the user.

Sight++ analyses images from the cameras and detects objections within them—this is then sent to the location server for real-time environment insight.
