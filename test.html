                    <p>
                        We used 2 main testing techniques to ensure our software meets the specific requirements to produce a quality product, Functional testing, and Non-Functional testing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For functional testing of the AVINA location server, we have written unit tests on functions and integration tests on the REST API functionalities. The tests cover a wide range of the location server’s functionality, specifically there are 34 tests that run in 3 seconds, achieving 90.77% statement coverage, 81.74% branch coverage, 86.08% function coverage and 91.14% line coverage. The tests were created using Mocha, a JavaScript test framework running on Node.js which allows asynchronous test , test coverage report and the use of any assertion library. We also used Chai as a Test Driven Development / Behavior Driven Development assertion library with Mocha. The organisation server adopted the same functional testing strategy as location server.
                    </p>

                <div class="container text mb-5">
                    <p>
                        For our app, the functions require inputs from the real world, for example, user’s speech, Wi-Fi signals and Bluetooth beacon signals, so these cases were not mockable. In this situation, we used system tests to ensure the correctness of our functions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Unit Test. The communication between the app and the location server can be tested through unit test. There are four situations, and the testing results are shown in Table 1.

                        The remaining functions of the location server and the mobile app are tested through manual system tests, as the Table 2 shows below. These results show that our service meets the requirements and works as expected.

                    <p>In the future, we envision our system to be able to provide real-time insights to a user ahead of visiting a AVINA enabled location. For that reason, we need to secure the location server’s APIs so that we can expose it to the internet. The application right now can be configured to use a self-signed SSL certificate, but changes are needed to ensure the security of the system. The same optimisation to ensure the server is secure needs to be done for the organisation server as well. </p>
                    <p>Once the location server is exposed to the Internet, further work can be done on the location server and the app to remove the need for a UDP connection to be established between the two for the app to get access to information. </p>
                    <p>Currently, we only provide information to the user about physical queueing and waiting area space utilization. In the future, we hope we can add support for static points of interests such as footfall—and directions to seating, pathways, exits, washrooms, or specific offices and rooms.</p>
